"MongoDB":http://www.mongodb.org/ is a scalable, high-performance, schemafree and "production ready":http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Production+Deployments NoSQL database. This plugin implements the GORM functionality for MongoDB. Under the hood it uses "Morphia":http://code.google.com/p/morphia/ as a lightweight type-safe library for mapping domain classes to/from MongoDB.

h3. Features

Features implemented to far:
* Instance methods: save, delete
* Class methods: get, find, findAll, delete, deleteAll, exists, count, list
* Dynamic finders like findAllByNameAndDegreeBetween(...)
* Constraints and validation support
* Automatic timestamping of dateCreated and lastUpdated
* Gorm events beforeSave, afterSave, beforeDelete, afterDelete, beforeValidate (others, like afterLoad are supported by "Morphia":http://code.google.com/p/morphia/wiki/LifecycleMethods )
* Works with MongoDB 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0
* AST Transformations that inject all necessary fields and annotations for morphia
* Lazy references supported (experimental)
* generate-all support

This plugin is not feature complete concerning the GORM api. Yet it has been proven to be very stable in our production environment. See the "quickstart":2.%20Quickstart.html page for a usage example. You can also download a "petclinic sample application port":https://github.com/jkuehn/gorm-mongodb which uses mongodb-morphia to see the use of embedded and referenced domain classes.
